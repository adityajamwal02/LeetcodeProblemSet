/*
Given two strings A and B. Find minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a Substring of it. If B can never be a substring then return -1.

Example 1:
Input:
A = "abcd"
B = "cdabcdab"
Output:
3
Explanation:
Repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”),
B is a substring of it. B is not a substring
of A when it is repeated less than 3 times.

Example 2:
Input:
A = "ab"
B = "cab"
Output :
-1
Explanation:
No matter how many times we repeat A, we can't
get a string such that B is a substring of it.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minRepeats() which takes 2 strings A, and B respectively and returns the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. Return -1 if it's not possible.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|A| * |B|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|B|)
